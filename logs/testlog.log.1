Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organizations environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes

Using reputable outside sources for vulnerability information?
Assigning a risk ranking to vulnerabilities that includes identification of all "high risk and "critical vulnerabilities?
Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organizations environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes

Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organizations environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.

Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organizations environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.
