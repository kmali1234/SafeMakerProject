Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organizations environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes
