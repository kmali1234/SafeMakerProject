2016-02-02 12:54:07,364 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Is there a process to identify security vulnerabilities, including the following:
Using reputable outside sources for vulnerability information?
Assigning a risk ranking to vulnerabilities that includes identification of all "high” risk and "critical” vulnerabilities?
Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes

2016-02-02 14:10:52,249 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Is there a process to identify security vulnerabilities, including the following:
Using reputable outside sources for vulnerability information?
Assigning a risk ranking to vulnerabilities that includes identification of all "high” risk and "critical” vulnerabilities?
Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes

Using reputable outside sources for vulnerability information?
Assigning a risk ranking to vulnerabilities that includes identification of all "high” risk and "critical” vulnerabilities?
Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes

Note: SSL and early TLS are not considered strong cryptography and cannot be used as a security control after 30th June, 2016. Prior to this date, existing implementations that use SSL and/or early TLS must have a formal Risk Mitigation and Migration Plan in place.
Effective immediately, new implementations must not use SSL or early TLS.
POS POI terminals (and the SSL/TLS termination points to which they connect) that can be verified as not being susceptible to any known exploits for SSL and early TLS may continue using these as a security control after 30th June, 2016." is answered as Yes

Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes
