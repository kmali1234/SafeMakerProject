Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed. Examples of critical systems may include security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that store, process or transmit cardholder data." is answered as Yes

Using reputable outside sources for vulnerability information?
Assigning a risk ranking to vulnerabilities that includes identification of all "high” risk and "critical” vulnerabilities?
Note: Risk rankings should be based on industry best practices as well as consideration of potential impact. For example, criteria for ranking vulnerabilities may include consideration of the CVSS base score and/or the classification by the vendor, and/or type of systems affected.
Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.

Methods for evaluating vulnerabilities and assigning risk ratings will vary based on an organization’s environment and risk assessment strategy. Risk rankings should, at a minimum, identify all vulnerabilities considered to be a "high risk” to the environment. In addition to the risk ranking, vulnerabilities may be considered "critical” if they pose an imminent threat to the environment, impact critical systems, and/or would result in a potential compromise if not addressed.

2016-02-09 16:50:44,999 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Are penetration-testing procedures defined to test all segmentation methods, to confirm they are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE?" is answered as Yes
2016-02-09 16:50:46,487 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Does penetration testing to verify segmentation controls meet the following?
Performed at least annually and after any changes to segmentation controls/methods
Covers all segmentation controls/methods in use
Verifies that segmentation methods are operational and effective, and isolate all out-of-scope systems from systems in the CDE." is answered as Yes
2016-02-09 16:50:48,000 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Is a change-detection mechanism (for example, file-integrity monitoring tools) deployed within the cardholder data environment to detect unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical system files, configuration files, or content files?
Examples of files that should be monitored include:
System executables
Application executables
Configuration and parameter files
Centrally stored, historical or archived, log, and audit files
Additional critical files determined by entity (for example, through risk assessment or other means)" is answered as Yes
2016-02-09 16:50:49,487 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Is the change-detection mechanism configured to alert personnel to unauthorized modification (including changes, additions, and deletions) of critical system files, configuration files or content files, and do the tools perform critical file comparisons at least weekly?
Note: For change detection purposes, critical files are usually those that do not regularly change, but the modification of which could indicate a system compromise or risk of compromise. Change detection mechanisms such as file-integrity monitoring products usually come pre-configured with critical files for the related operating system. Other critical files, such as those for custom applications, must be evaluated and defined by the entity (that is the merchant or service provider)." is answered as Yes
2016-02-09 16:50:50,974 - java.lang.Class - INFO -  Question: "Is a process in place to respond to any alerts generated by the change-detection solution?" is answered as Yes
